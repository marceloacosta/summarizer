The certificate of health for the export of pets (dogs, cats, and ferrets) requires identification of the animal and its owner, as well as a certification from a veterinarian that the animal is clinically healthy, free from contagious diseases, and has been treated for parasites. The certificate must also include information on the animal's vaccination and deworming programs, and if the animal is being exported to Finland, the UK, Ireland, or Malta, it must have been treated for Echinococcus multilocularis. Destination-specific requirements should also be attached to the certificate.

The document outlines vaccination and deworming requirements for pets being transported to certain destinations. The vaccine must be for rabies, and the deworming must be effective against Echinococcus multilocularis. A veterinarian's signature and information is required, and specific requirements for the destination must be included. The same requirements are listed for ferrets with a certificate of vaccination for rabies.
