Mailchimp provides an email marketing service to their customers. tienne points to Send Time Optimization, a premium feature I personally use in Mailchimp. This feature analyzes when the subscribers are most active and thus determines what the best time to send your newsletter is. The times when open rates (of email) are the highest across industries are known. So, we could build a service allowing Mailchimp customers to import their subscriber list with IP addresses to determine users' time zones; it is simple to then calculate the optimal time to send out a newsletter. This functionality could quite easily be developed as a stand-alone product that would then serve anyone wanting to send automated emails to a subscriber list at the best time, even if they are using other providers.  Figma  Figma, a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool, doesnt have good support for iPads, so Matias Martinez built an app called Figurative31 which allows people to run Figma on iPads. His very rst version already has a 4.3/5 rating on the Apple App Store. Another element that could potentially be extracted from Figma is their Version History feature, that allows you to view and restore earlier versions of a le, but which is only available for free for 30 days.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Several software products like Mailchimp, Figma, Soundcloud, and Reddit have features that could potentially be unbundled and developed as stand-alone products. For example, Mailchimp's Send Time Optimization could be used to build a service that determines the optimal time to send automated emails. Figma's Version History feature could be turned into an external version control tool. Soundcloud's discontinued macOS app inspired the development of DaftCloud32, a new independent app. And Reddit's big communities, known as subreddits, can be leveraged for other purposes.
