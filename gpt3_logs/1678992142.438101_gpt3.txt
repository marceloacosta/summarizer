It seems like its a good technique to nd subreddits where users are creating content of any kind. There is a public list of subreddits you can explore and see what communities are popular at redditlist.com. 65GENERATING PRODUCT IDEAS #10: Data sets Many governments, municipalities, public bodies, and even corporations open some of their data to the public to let them build services around it. Governments dont always have the resources to build these services themselves and, by allowing everyone the opportunity to get involved, they save money and time while still allowing for innovation and problem solving using the public data. Here are some examples of the areas in which the UK government gives away data:  Business and economy  small businesses, industry, imports, exports and trade  Crime and justice  courts, police, prisons, offenders, borders and immigration  Defense  armed forces, health and safety, search and rescue  Education  students, training, qualications and the National Curriculum  Environment  weather, ooding, rivers, air quality, geology and agriculture  Government  staff numbers and pay, local counselors and department business plans  Government spending  Health  smoking, drugs, alcohol, medicine performance and hospitals  Mapping  addresses, boundaries, land ownership, aerial photographs, seabed and land terrain 66#10: DATA SETS  Society  employment, benets, household nances, poverty and population  Towns and cities  housing, urban planning, leisure, waste and energy, consumption  Transport  airports, roads, freight, electric vehicles, parking, buses and footpaths Step 1: Explore data sets Here are some places you could nd open data:  Data.gov.uk

RESPONSE:

The article suggests two ways to generate business ideas - creating communities through websites and apps, and using open data sets. It provides examples of popular subreddits and open data sets in various areas such as business, environment, and transportation. The first method involves creating platforms for user-generated content and reviews on beauty products and books, replacing existing subreddits. The second method involves exploring open data sets provided by governments, corporations, and public bodies in areas such as crime, education, and society. The article suggests using websites such as redditlist.com and data.gov.uk to identify popular communities and data sets.
