Often, however, a better strategy is to serve the people or businesses who are part of the trend; get to selling the pickaxes rather than mining the gold. Step 1: List trends Timing in utilizing trends could be a critical factor. For example, gold miners will be happy to pay for the pickaxes that will help them to get ahead of the curve.

RESPONSE:

Samuel Brannan sold supplies to gold miners instead of mining for gold themselves, which turned out to be more profitable. The strategy of serving people or businesses involved in a trend rather than directly participating in it can be effective. To identify trends, resources such as Explodingtopics.com, TrendHunter.com, and Trends.co can be helpful. It's important to filter trends based on relevance and personal interest. Finding opportunities to serve participants in a trend can be more beneficial than competing with them. One example is Oneet, which provides delivery management services for companies like HelloFresh, Meadow, and Imperfect Food and has had revenue of $4.8m.
