products for sign language integration, so Id avoid replicating their app and encroaching on their income. Instead use this as an example only.) 52#6: IMPROVE ABANDONED BUT USEFUL PRODUCTS  Scheduled App27 allows you to schedule your text messages in SMS, iMessage, and WhatsApp, to be sent at specic times. With a 3.1 average rating (and almost 1000 reviews) this is clearly an underachieving product in a substantial potential market. 53GENERATING PRODUCT IDEAS #7: Localization of existing solutions This technique is similar to the cross-industries approach in that it starts with considering an existing product and its potential feasibility in another context. Although here, instead of moving products between industries, we will explore whether we can move them from one market and language to another. Step 1: List countries, regions, and languages youre familiar with Being bilingual, or having experience of living in several countries, gives you the advantage of understanding the culture, language, and needs of another place. You probably also have connections in these locations. It means that you can more effectively create products for these markets or in these languages. For me, for example, such a list would look like this:  Israel  Belarus / Russia  Germany  Russian  Hebrew  German  English 54#7: LOCALIZATION OF EXISTING SOLUTIONS Step 2: List products worth replicating Now we want to think of problems and solutions which are worth replicating.

If they struggle to think of something, ask them what products they bought in the last six months.  Think of products you nd valuable yourself.

RESPONSE:

The article suggests two techniques for coming up with new product ideas: improving underachieving products and localizing existing solutions. The first technique involves identifying products with potential markets and finding ways to improve them. The second technique involves considering existing products in one language or market and exploring the possibility of replicating them in another language or market. The article suggests creating a list of countries, regions, and languages that one is familiar with and then asking people about products they like in those areas, as well as thinking of products one finds valuable or has seen recently.
