that would have value outside of the organization.  Audiences and niches that the organization ignored because they were too small for them (often 34#3: INSIDER IDEAS corporations or VC-backed companies choose to focus only on big markets).  Processes that the organization routinely outsourced.  Products or features that the organization eliminated for reasons that werent necessarily related to the lack of traction (i.e. a change of company priorities or restructuring).

There are many examples of this technique being used by startups. Asana (with a $1.5b valuation and plans to go public later in 202010), a task management tool, was created by Dustin Moskovitz after he developed a similar internal work management tool while working for Facebook.11 The idea behind the network security company, Check Point (with a $15b market cap in 202012), emerged while the founder, Gil Shwed, was serving in the Israeli military, where he worked on securing classied networks. When the internet emerged in the early 90s, he applied similar technology concepts to those he used to work on in the military to build his product for IT security. In 2016, I led the design of several products at WeWork. Here are two insider ideas I had from my experience there: Aggregating user research One of my colleagues, Tomer Sharon, built an internal system called Polaris with his team. It allowed him to collect 35GENERATING PRODUCT IDEAS and organize user interviews the research team would perform.

The next step is to explore these ideas and determine if they are viable. Examples of successful startups using this technique include Asana and Check Point. An internal system called Polaris was created at WeWork to aggregate and organize user research data for easier access and utilization.
