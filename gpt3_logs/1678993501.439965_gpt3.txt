After working on several iOS mobile apps, we noticed the same pattern emerging in the problems we encountered we didnt have a way to track the bugs in our customers apps. Moreover, the time we spent debugging would swallow about 20-30% of development 22#1: SOLVING YOUR OWN BUSINESS PROBLEMS time. We decided to create a product solving this inefficiency: a debugging tool for iOS developers that automatically learns what the production issues are in apps, cutting debug time from hours to seconds.

I started noticing how time-consuming and frustrating the manual process of exporting UI assets was to our junior designers. To optimize this process, I built Retinize It. It was a simple Photoshop action (similar to Macros in Word) that didnt require any coding skills for me to build it. With one click, this tool


CONCISE SUMMARY:
