products automating the services Fiverr Many of the Fiverr gigs can be transformed into a self- service product that will solve the needs of the customer and make it faster, better, and cheaper. You could either completely automate it or partially outsource tasks to Amazon Mechanical Turk. Logo design is one of the most popular services on Fiverr. Tailor Brands is a company that automates logo and branding creation. They have 14 million users, with 500 million designs created via their product. A service I used on Fiverr is buying contact lists of audience segments such as parenting bloggers or journalists whom I intended to reach out to regarding my product. Automating such a service would mean web-scraping publicly available data and making it searchable. Such a product could lower the 59GENERATING PRODUCT IDEAS barrier for small businesses to access journalists, or make it easier for PR agencies to do their jobs. JustReachOut does exactly that, and their cheapest plan is $159/month including emails to 50 journalists. One technique for nding relevant journalists on your topic is to search for related news and reach out to the journalists who wrote about it recently. This process can be partially automated via Google News API as it can nd all authors who wrote on topics including specic keywords; then you can nd their contact data via Hunter.io or Mechanical Turk. Etsy When it comes to Etsy, one of the popular digital products are certicate templates for school diplomas etc. Such templates require editing, one-by-one, using a different piece of software. You could build a better certicate product with more exibility, to capture the market which Etsy is currently satisfying. Your templates could allow schools to do design adjustments and upload a list of students to generate ready- to-print PDF les much more quickly. Next step could be creating a partnership with a printing company who would produce the certicates and provide you with a cut. 60#9: PRODUCT
