Nations Step 2: Find the reasons the vision is not a reality After dening the vision, we know where we are going. Now we need to build a list of reasons why were not there yet.

This is a negative vision, which means were trying to move away from it. The good thing about trying to nd ideas that help to solve global problems is that a massive amount of effort has been put into researching and understanding the problems already. On the topic of microplastics in the oceans, we can nd reports18 showing an exact breakdown of the causes of pollution and the percentage of their contribution to the problem:  Laundry of synthetic textiles  35%  Car tires  28%  City dust  24%  Road markings  7%  Marine coatings  4%  Personal care products  2% Step 3: List ways of solving these obstacles Once we have listed the problems, we can come up with ideas for possible solutions. Below are some examples. 40#4: VISION-BASED IDEAS Microplastics in the oceans LANGBRETT is a small, sustainable clothing company in Germany that is founded by a group of surfers.

To make a vision a reality, it's important to understand the reasons why it hasn't been achieved yet. For negative visions, it's important to identify what causes the problem and for positive visions, what is preventing it. For example, one vision could be to prevent microplastics from getting into the ocean. Reports show that laundry of synthetic textiles contributes the most to the problem. Companies like LANGBRETT have come up with solutions like creating laundry bags that can filter out microplastics. The key is to list the problems and find creative ways to solve them.
