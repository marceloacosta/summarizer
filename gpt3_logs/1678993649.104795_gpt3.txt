JustReachOut does exactly that, and their cheapest plan is $159/month including emails to 50 journalists. One technique for nding relevant journalists on your topic is to search for related news and reach out to the journalists who wrote about it recently. This process can be partially automated via Google News API as it can nd all authors who wrote on topics including specic keywords; then you can nd their contact data via Hunter.io or Mechanical Turk.

You could build a better certicate product with more exibility, to capture the market which Etsy is currently satisfying. Your templates could allow schools to do design adjustments and upload a list of students to generate ready- to-print PDF les much more quickly. Next step could be creating a partnership with a printing company who would produce the certicates and provide you with a cut. 60#9: PRODUCT
