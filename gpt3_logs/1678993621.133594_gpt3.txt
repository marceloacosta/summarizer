markets. However, companies might decide that some countries are too small to bother investing in, while it might still be a big enough market for your business. Moreover, companies will most probably choose to expand only when they have a solid footing in their home market. Even when they are well-established there, the next market they choose will probably be one of the big ones. For example, a product that starts in California will probably rst expand to other states in the US, after which it might launch in Canada, Australia and then maybe the UK, Germany, and France, etc. If you have a small country on your list, there is a chance that the big players might reach it very late or not at all. The giants of the tech industry reached Israel only recently  Amazon in 2019, Spotify in 2018, and Netix in 2016. However, you probably dont want to compete with these companies as they are large, powerful, and their products are hard to build. Still, the point is, if even they pass on certain 55GENERATING PRODUCT IDEAS markets, its likely that smaller companies might not have enough resources, ambition, or interest to reach your geographical area or language very soon. It leaves you with an opportunity to be the rst (and maybe the only) player in your market and also to have the rst-mover advantage.

Besides, such small niches might mean a stronger and more committed community, which makes it easier to penetrate the market and sell your goods.

RESPONSE:

Companies may overlook smaller countries as potential markets, providing an opportunity for smaller businesses to enter and establish themselves as the first-mover advantage. Furthermore, smaller niches in these markets may be overlooked by larger companies, allowing for a stronger and more committed community to develop. Businesses should consider the feasibility of bringing their products to new countries, regions, or languages in order to seize these opportunities.
