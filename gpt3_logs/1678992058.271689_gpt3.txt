and make it frictionless for them to switch workspaces while moving between countries. 37GENERATING PRODUCT IDEAS #4: Vision-based ideas I like how Erika Hall denes design: its the gap between what currently exists and what youre aiming for.14 Id say that this denition would also work well in describing entrepreneurship. A great way to start thinking of product ideas is to dene what it is that youre aiming for. Step 1: Dene your vision Think of how you believe the world should look in the future, compare this image to how it is now, and ll in the gaps with your product or service. Your vision will probably belong to one of two categories:  Bring something positive closer e.g. make healthcare more accessible; make pets live longer; teach kids to be more creative.  Move away from something negative e.g. reduce smoking in developing countries; reduce microplastic pollution in the ocean; help people to have less physical pain in their workspace. You might already know what problems youd like to tackle. Otherwise, if youre looking to make a positive impact but not sure how, here are three resources to help you do that:  80000hours.org. Eighty thousand hours is the number of hours in your career, and this non-prot explores how you can best use these 80,000 hours to help solve the worlds most pressing problems.  The UN Sustainable Development Goals15 are a plan for building a better world for people and our planet by 38#4: VISION-BASED IDEAS 2030. These goals include ending poverty, improving health and education, reducing inequality, and spurring economic growth  all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.  Project Drawdown16 explores solutions17 for climate change and prioritizes them by impact, measured by gigatons of equivalent CO2 reduced. By tackling the problems listed in these resources, you can be condent that your effort will count. Figure 4.1 List of Sustainable Development Goals created by the United

To generate product ideas, one should start by defining their vision for how the world should look in the future, and then filling in the gaps with their product or service. This can involve bringing something positive closer or moving away from something negative. Resources such as 80000hours.org, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and Project Drawdown can help identify pressing problems to tackle. Making it easy for people to switch workspaces while moving between countries was suggested as an example of a vision-based idea.
