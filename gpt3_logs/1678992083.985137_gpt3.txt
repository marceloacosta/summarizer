Write a concise summary of the following:


stand used by different audiences One day, my friend, who is a music producer, came by and saw this stand under my laptop. He took a sampling drum machine from his bag, put it on the stand, and it tted like a glove. Later, we tested it out on his synthesizers and other drum machines, and many of them tted well on my laptop stands. He uses three of my stands now in his music setup. Many of the stands for musicians are two to three times more expensive than my laptop stands (I assume due to a smaller, more specialized market). It also solves an audience- specic problem, as my stands portability allows musicians to easily carry it to their gigs. So, Im currently working on this opportunity to bring an already existing product to a different industry and offer musicians a high-quality solution for a better price. 49GENERATING PRODUCT IDEAS #6: Improve abandoned but useful products Some products get some traction but are not maintained well by the creators for different reasons and are thus abandoned. It could be a switch of focus, a lack of skills and resources, or an agenda that wont allow them to make necessary changes to the product (for example, they might have a business model of selling users data to advertisers, while many users are increasingly trying to avoid such products). Finding these fallen products and building a better version of them is a robust strategy as it generates ideas that are already demand-validated. Step 1: Find in demand products with low ratings To nd in demand but low-rated products, start by searching stores that consolidate products; here you can nd out how popular the product is and how well it meets users needs from the reviews. You could use App Store (iOS, macOS, Apple TV), Google Play, Amazon Apps Store (skills for Echo, apps for Kindle), Chrome Store Extensions, or Trustpilot. To make the search easier, use:  App Annie23  The free trial version allows you to preview the top app charts for iOS, Apple TV, macOS, Google


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The article suggests two methods for generating product ideas: finding an existing product and adapting it for a different audience, or improving upon abandoned products that are still in demand. The first method involves identifying a product that fits a different market, such as laptop stands being repurposed for music equipment. The second method involves searching for popular products with low ratings, then improving upon them to better meet user needs. Tools such as App Annie can help identify these products.
