PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


made about $100,000 in sales without marketing (most of which are prots since it was self-published) in the rst year. Figure 5.1 Books for preparing for job interviews in different roles Keyboard stickers boosting productivity in different professions Another product that I based on an existing concept from other industries was SketchKeys. In 2016, an app called Sketch started to gain momentum among interface designers and became the new industry standard, replacing Photoshop. Sketch had keyboard shortcuts that are nothing like the ones in Photoshop. I remembered colorful keyboard stickers that I saw video editors using and thought that these could work for designers as well. Since Sketch is a professional app, the user spends most of their day on it, using a lot of repetitive tools and functions. Using shortcuts is a great way to improve productivity and, if I could help designers to learn new shortcuts and save just 3% of their time, it would accumulate 47GENERATING PRODUCT IDEAS into a signicant amount of saved resources. It could also improve the workspace ergonomics since keyboard shortcuts provide an alternative to a mouse, overuse of which can lead to discomfort, pain, and health disorders. Figure 5.2 SketchKeys  keyboard stickers with shortcuts for design app Figma I ended up building such stickers for Sketch and then for other design tools like Figma and Adobe XD. I didnt put too much effort into this project and didnt do any marketing, so its been running passively for the last four years, almost without requiring any attention, averaging $8,000 yearly sales with about an 80% margin. Stands for laptops and musical instruments One of the products Im producing that is not just for designers is laptop stands made locally from eco-friendly 48#5: CROSS-INDUSTRY PRODUCT INNOVATION plywood. It is mostly sold to companies who want it branded with their logo, so they can use the stands as giveaways at conferences or as a corporate gift. Figure 5.3 Wooden
