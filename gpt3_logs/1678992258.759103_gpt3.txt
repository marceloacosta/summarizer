cycle and those that care about the environment. One option could be to build sustainable cycling appliances; for example, there is no sustainable rain cover for bikes currently available. Most of the bike covers produced today are made of polyester 109GENERATING PRODUCT IDEAS or nylon. Neither are biodegradable, so they will sit in a landll for 20200 years if not recycled properly, and both are sourced from oil.  The sustainability conscious + planners  You could create planners for people who want to get closer to a zero- waste lifestyle. It could include tips and tasks for each week, with a goal to educate and create habits decreasing waste.  People with back pain + comparison tools  back pain is the leading cause of disability, preventing many people from engaging in work. Half of all working Americans admit to having back pain symptoms each year52. We could create a resource consolidating and producing high-quality information on back pain treatment, back pain relief, and management. Such a resource would include comparisons of different techniques for reducing back pain, including yoga, physiotherapy, massage techniques, rollers, etc.  Remote employees + analytics  This is not necessarily relevant only to remote employees, but it would be especially benecial for them. You could build a productivity analytics tool to track work productivity and provide insights on how it could be optimized; for example, which hours are the most productive, how caffeine or power naps affect productivity, and at what times do they seem to work best. 110W H E R E T O F I N D M O R E I D E A S All products are remixes of problems, ideas, and existing products. Creating these remixes is often a process of connecting the dots. To make these connections more likely, we need to increase the pool of dots we can possibly connect. Thats why being exposed to ideas, products, and problems is so helpful. Heres a list of sources that are helpful in exposing yourself to more dots.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The article suggests four potential product ideas: sustainable cycling appliances, zero-waste planners, a resource for back pain management, and a productivity analytics tool for remote employees. The author encourages connecting existing problems, ideas, and products to create new solutions and recommends seeking out new sources of inspiration.
