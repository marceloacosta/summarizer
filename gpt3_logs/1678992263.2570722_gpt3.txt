Getting exposed to ideas Here are some resources I nd helpful:  Crowdsourcing platforms  Kickstarter and Indiegogo have thousands of innovative ideas being crowdfunded, which may spark our own creative thinking.

One of the websites you can use for such insights is Statista.com. Interact with people Besides consuming information from the web, a good way to get exposed to ideas is through people; they can lter a lot of the noise for you and might provide valuable insights:  Serial entrepreneurs  People who have had several businesses are probably very good at coming up with ideas and have plenty of them. Most of them have more ideas than resources and time and usually dont mind sharing some of them.  People from unsexy industries  Talk to people in businesses like logistics, trash management, and funeral organizing. These are things that many entrepreneurs would avoid, which probably means that they are underserved in terms of creative solutions and promise opportunities for innovation. People working in these industries could be the key to understanding what problems they are experiencing and what needs to be solved.  Meetups  Im co-organizing the monthly IndieHackers meetup in Berlin. Its a casual meetup without an agenda, where small business owners (or sometimes aspiring business owners) gather and exchange experiences and ideas. People
