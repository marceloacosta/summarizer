PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


manufacturers, external product review companies (Wirecutter, iFixit, Consumer Reports), repair businesses, and the consumers themselves. Durability reporting would help consumers to make sustainable (and also economically-viable) choices, decreasing waste and encouraging purchasing of products that are less likely to quickly end up at the landll. 43P A R T 2 : R E P L I C A T E A N D I M P R O V E There are two things Ive learned while generating new product ideas: everything is a remix of existing things and everything can be improved.

Although here, instead of bringing a product to a new market or language and adjusting it for this context, were going to shift between industries. Step 1: Make a list of valuable products We want to bring products from other industries to ours or ones we are very familiar with, so we need to start with listing products outside of our industry that are working well. It doesnt necessarily mean that they are going to be successful in your niche, but its a good starting point that might improve the chances of success. Heres how you can start:  Ask people from other industries what products they love using personally or for their business and what products they bought in the last year.  Think of products that youre using which you rate highly, especially if you are multidisciplinary, in terms of working


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Durability reporting could help consumers make sustainable choices that encourage purchasing less wasteful products. Product creation often involves remixing and improving on existing concepts. Techniques for new product innovation include cross-industry product innovation, improving abandoned but useful products, localizing existing solutions, automating marketplace services and products, product unbundling, and data sets. Cross-industry product innovation involves bringing valuable products from other industries into a new industry or niche. This can be achieved by asking people from other industries what products they love or by listing highly-rated multidisciplinary products currently in use.
